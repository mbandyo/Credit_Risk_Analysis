# Credit Risk Analysis
This project builds and compares several models using different methodologies for supervised Machine Learning and compares model performances.
Predicting credit risk is an imprtant aspect for lenders. The accuracy of credit risk predition would enable a lender avoid approving risky loans and charging appropriate risk premiums. However, a strict and conservative lending policy would hurt the business, market share, revenues and profits and reputation of the institution. This could threaten the sustainability of the business. Therefore, it is very important for a lending institution to assess the risk of a loan and balance this risk with ongoing business sustainability. 
The challenge of using standard methods are that sometimes the decisions need to be made fairly quickly with limited data. Since the number of defaults are small compared to the number of loans issued, traditional statistical methods may be challening in adeqaute loan risk assessment. The industry is increasingly using ML languages for these type of modeling for robust analysis. Also credit is a highly regulated industry and the business practices are scrutinized by regulators in great detail and punitive actions are imposed on the lending institutions for smallest violations.  Therefore, it is important for a lending instutions to robust models to manage both business and regulatory risks.
